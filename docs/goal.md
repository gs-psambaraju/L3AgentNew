# L3Agent Project Goal

## Overview
The L3Agent is designed to be an intelligent support assistant that handles support tickets raised by the support team. It leverages agent tool calling capabilities, structural code analysis, semantic search, LLM integration with comprehensive metadata tracking, and an MCP server to provide accurate and timely responses to support inquiries across complex codebases.

## Primary Objectives
1. **Automated Ticket Resolution** - Enable the L3Agent to process and resolve support tickets with minimal human intervention.
2. **Knowledge Integration** - Utilize multiple information sources for comprehensive responses:
   - Source code from repositories with both semantic and structural understanding
   - System logs
   - Knowledge base articles
   - Historical responses and feedback
3. **Cross-Repository Understanding** - Provide context-aware explanations spanning multiple repositories:
   - Trace workflows across system boundaries
   - Explain relationships between components
   - Identify dependency chains and execution flows
4. **LLM Interaction Transparency** - Maintain complete metadata about LLM interactions:
   - Track model versions and configurations used
   - Record request and response details
   - Link responses to knowledge sources
   - Provide clear attributions and confidence levels
   - Disclose knowledge limitations and currency

## Enhanced Capabilities
1. **Semantic Code Understanding** - Use vector embeddings to find conceptually relevant code
   - **Key Priority**: Critical for accurate and comprehensive responses
   - Transform code understanding from lexical matching to semantic comprehension
   - Enable natural language queries against technical codebases
   - Benefits:
     - Find related code even when terminology differs
     - Understand conceptual relationships between components
     - Identify functionally similar code across repositories
     - Reduce false positives from keyword-based searches
     - Provide more accurate entry points for structural exploration
   - Implementation Benefits:
     - Significantly improved response accuracy
     - Reduced need for exact terminology in queries
     - Better handling of domain-specific concepts
     - More robust cross-repository understanding
     - Improved context relevance for LLM prompts

2. **Structural Relevance** - Leverage code relationships through knowledge graph analysis:
   - Class hierarchies and inheritance relationships
   - Interface implementations
   - Method call graphs and data flows
   - Cross-component dependencies
3. **Bidirectional Retrieval** - Combine semantic and structural approaches:
   - Use semantic matches as entry points for structural exploration
   - Enhance structural matches with semantic context
   - Handle cases where one approach may be stronger than the other
4. **LLM Provider Abstraction** - Support multiple LLM providers through abstraction:
   - Provider-agnostic interfaces
   - Configuration-driven model selection
   - Standardized error handling and fallbacks
   - Performance metrics collection
5. **Comprehensive Metadata Tracking** - Record detailed information about interactions:
   - Complete prompt context and knowledge sources
   - Model parameters and configuration
   - Response provenance and attributions
   - Latency and token usage metrics
   - Quality assessment and feedback

## POC Scope
For the proof of concept, the L3Agent will:
- Use locally stored data sources rather than live connections to external systems
- **Implement vector embeddings for semantic code search as highest priority**
  - Focus on efficient chunking and embedding generation
  - Select appropriate embedding models for code
  - Develop effective vector similarity search
  - Create robust evaluation metrics for retrieval quality
- Build a knowledge graph for structural code relationships
- Deploy bidirectional retrieval for comprehensive code understanding
- Develop LLM provider abstraction with configurable model selection
- Implement metadata tracking for all LLM interactions
- Demonstrate end-to-end functionality with realistic multi-repository queries

## Success Criteria
- Accurately interpret support ticket queries
- Provide relevant and helpful responses based on available information
- Maintain context across interactions within a support ticket
- Demonstrate ability to trace execution flows across repositories
- Explain relationships between components in different codebases
- Show superior performance compared to simple pattern matching approach
- Clearly disclose knowledge limitations and request additional context when needed
- Maintain comprehensive metadata for all LLM interactions
- Learn from feedback to improve future responses

## Future Capabilities (Post-POC)
- Integration with GitHub for code access
- Connection to cloud storage (S3) for logs and knowledge base articles
- Continuous learning from historical ticket resolutions
- Advanced visualization of code relationships
- Runtime data integration for dynamic behavior understanding
- Enhanced LLM provider ecosystem with automatic fallbacks
- Advanced analytics on LLM performance and response quality
- Cost optimization based on query complexity and model selection
