# L3Agent Project Tracker

## Project Context and Vision

### Project Overview
L3Agent is an intelligent system designed to answer technical questions through deep code analysis. It serves as a support acceleration tool that helps engineers understand complex codebases, diagnose issues, and provide accurate technical guidance by combining code search, analysis, and domain knowledge.

### Core Problems Being Solved
1. **Knowledge Access Gap**: Support engineers struggle to quickly locate relevant code to answer customer questions
2. **Context Fragmentation**: Information about system behavior is scattered across multiple repositories and components
3. **Runtime Complexity**: Static code analysis alone misses critical runtime behaviors and interactions
4. **Configuration Impact**: Difficult to understand how configuration changes impact overall system behavior
5. **Cross-Component Understanding**: Engineers need visibility across service boundaries to diagnose complex issues

### Architectural Evolution
L3Agent has evolved through several architectural approaches:

#### Initial Vector-Based Approach (Previous Phase)
- Focused on semantic code search using embeddings
- Generated vector representations of code chunks
- Used similarity search to find relevant code snippets
- Limitations:
  - Only provided code snippets without runtime context
  - Couldn't trace execution flows or configuration impacts
  - Limited to pre-computed knowledge with no dynamic analysis
  - Offered ~60% confidence for complex cross-component issues

#### Knowledge Graph Attempt (Discontinued)
- Tried to model code relationships as a graph
- Used Neo4j to store class/method relationships
- Created navigable representation of code structure
- Discontinued due to:
  - Scalability issues with large codebases
  - Complex schema maintenance
  - Difficulty representing dynamic behaviors
  - Redundancy with vector search for most use cases

#### Current Hybrid Architecture (In Progress)
- Combines pre-computed knowledge with dynamic tool calling
- Uses Model Control Plane (MCP) to orchestrate analysis tools
- Implements specialized analysis capabilities:
  - Dynamic call path analysis
  - Cross-repository tracing
  - Error chain mapping
  - Configuration impact analysis
- Benefits:
  - Improved confidence for complex issues (estimated 7.5-9/10)
  - Dynamic analysis of runtime behavior
  - Targeted investigations based on initial vector search
  - Extensible tooling architecture

### Strategic Approach
Our strategy employs a two-phase approach to technical question answering:

1. **Initial Knowledge Retrieval**:
   - Use vector-based search to narrow the scope of inquiry
   - Identify relevant code sections across repositories
   - Establish baseline understanding of components involved

2. **Dynamic Analysis**:
   - Deploy specialized analysis tools for targeted investigation
   - Trace execution paths, configuration impacts, and error chains
   - Generate comprehensive answers that include both static and runtime understanding

### Success Metrics
- **Technical Accuracy**: Target 90%+ accuracy for complex technical questions
- **Response Time**: 90% of queries answered in <5 seconds
- **Resource Efficiency**: <2GB memory usage per JVM instance
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce time to resolution by 60%+
- **Support Escalation Reduction**: Decrease L2/L3 escalations by 40%+

### Key Decision Log

|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Q4 2022 | Adopt vector embeddings approach | Enables semantic search without complex schema maintenance | Graph databases, full-text search, AST parsing |
| Q1 2023 | Use HNSWLIB for vector storage | Superior performance for nearest neighbor search compared to alternatives | PostgreSQL vector, Elasticsearch, Pinecone |
| Q1 2023 | Discontinue Neo4j integration | Excessive maintenance overhead with limited additional value | Optimize graph queries, use hybrid representation |
| Q2 2023 | Remove OpenAI dependency | Consolidate on internal LLM service (Gainsight) for data security | Azure OpenAI Service, self-hosted models |
| Q2 2023 | Adopt hybrid architecture with MCP | Need for dynamic analysis capabilities to improve complex question answering | Enhanced static analysis, specialized embeddings |
| Q2 2023 | Implement configuration-driven retry framework | Standardize resilience across components while enabling flexible configurations | Spring Retry, custom annotations, service-specific implementations |

### Current Strategic Focus
We are implementing the Model Control Plane (MCP) architecture to enable dynamic analysis capabilities while preserving the existing investment in vector-based search. This hybrid approach leverages pre-computed knowledge for efficiency while adding runtime behavior insights for complex issue diagnosis.
