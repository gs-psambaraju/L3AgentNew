  "title": "Resolving NullPointerException in TaskProcessor",
  "content": "## Issue\nTasks may fail with a NullPointerException in the TaskProcessor.execute method, typically at line 245. This occurs when processing tasks with missing configuration parameters.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe TaskProcessor assumes that all task configurations contain a 'targetSystem' field. When this field is missing, a NullPointerException is thrown during execution.\n\n## Solution\n1. Check if the task configuration includes the required 'targetSystem' field\n2. Add validation in the TaskProcessor to gracefully handle missing fields\n3. Update task definitions to ensure all required parameters are specified\n\n## Prevention\n- Always include all required fields in task configurations\n- Use the TaskConfigurationValidator before submitting tasks\n- Monitor task failure logs for patterns of this exception",
